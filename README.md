# Module 19 - Unsupervised Learning

## Module Supplement

### 19.2.3 - Preprocessing Data With Pandas

- I would recommend opening a new Jupyter Notebook for this section. 
    - Be sure to include `import pandas as pd` in the first cell of your notebook

- When loading the `shopping_data.csv` make sure to have the `file_path` variable set to how you have the file saved. You may need to change what is given in the module code.

### 19.2.4 - Data Selection

- The article provided in the `What data is missing?` section gives a 404. Please use this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-handle-missing-data-8646b18db0d4) instead

### 19.3.2 - K-means Algorithm

- I would recommend opening a new notebook to practice K-means
- When printing the `model` your output may look a little different than what is shown in the module since the library has since updated what output is shown on the model. 

### 19.3.3 - Trial and Error of Finding Centroids

**Note: If you completed the Skill Drill in 19.2.5, you will need to change the column names to whatever you renamed them to**

- The graph of the K-means cluster on the module may look slightly different than the one you see. That is okay, as long as you see two clusters.

### 19.4.1 - Elbow Curve

- You can either create a new notebook or go back to the iris K-means practice notebook and modify it from 19.3.2

### 19.4.2 - Use the Elbow Curve

- You can either create a new notebook or go back to the one you were using from 19.3.3 where you created the K-means model on the shopping_data

**Note: Be sure to change the column names where you need to**

### 19.5.2 - Principal Component Analysis

- I would recommend starting a new notebook for this section

## Challenge Instruction Supplement

### Part 1

- When you download the starter notebook, you will need to replace  `from path import Path` to `from pathlib import Path`
